* Modify_TextGrid.praat (1.13.2015 by Seongjin Park)
    * Helper tool: This script opens wav and textgrid file with the same file name (e.g., *file1.wav* and *file1.TextGrid*) in the directory(s). You can simply press *continue* to save the modified TextGrid file and move on to the next wav and textgrid file. 
    * wav and textgrid file can be in the same directory (e.g., *files/*) or different directories (e.g., wav files in *wavs/* and textgrid files in *textgrids/*)
